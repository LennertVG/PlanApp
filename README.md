<h1>Project PlanApp - Gamified Planner App</h1>
<h3>Background and concept</h3>
This project is a collaboration between a group of students at SyntraPXL (developers) and a student of PXL Education (high school teacher).

The developers were approached by the high school teacher in regards to a concept for a gamified planner app designed for visual learners, to help them manage planning, make it more enjoyable and make it more visual than a generic task-list.

The project has been divided in 3 stages (as described below) in function of the deadlines assigned to the developers and teacher. 
<h3>Stage 1</h3>
<b>Stage 1 will run from the start of the project until the developers' deadline (31/05/2024 - 26/06/2024)</b>

In this stage the main functionality for the pupil interface of the planner will be created. The features described are the following:
- The pupil is able to create tasks with an intuitive interface
	- These tasks will be displayed in a manner to facilitate the visual thinkers
	- These tasks will be coupled to the pupils and their courses
	- In the future (see stage 2) tasks can be mass-assigned by teachers as well
- The pupil is able to upload evidence of the completion of a task
	- This can be in a variety of formats: pdf, doc, docx
- Once the pupil has uploaded this evidence, the teacher can confirm the completion of a task
	- Upon completion the pupil gets the following benefits
		- Coins
		- XP
		- Upon uploading in time: streak goes up
			- Upon reaching a streak of 5, 10, 15 and 20+, the pupil will gain increased coins and XP
		- After assignment of the aforementioned XP, if the pupil has enough XP they will level up, granting them coins 
	- These benefits will be displayed in the nav-bar for the student
- The pupil will be able to use these coins for rewards including but not limited to
	- Using headphones during individual work
	- The ability to skip a question asked by the teacher during class
	- ...
- If time permits a start of stage 2 will be made
<h3>Stage 2</h3>
<b>Stage 2 will run from the developers' deadline until the teacher's deadline (25/06/2024 - end of august 2024)</b>

Stage 2 will focus on refining the components of stage 1, creating a proper platform for teachers to mass assign tasks per class, more functionality for the class-group system, getting a workable first prototype up and running and more.
<h3>Stage 3</h3>
<b>Stage 3 will run from the teacher's deadline until a release date which is TBD (end of august 2024 - ?)</b>

Stage 3 will focus on the completion of all components in regards of bug-fixing, future-proofing, privacy-regulations, and polishing of all kinds. The exact work which needs to be done is also dependant on the succes of completing stage 1 and stage 2.
